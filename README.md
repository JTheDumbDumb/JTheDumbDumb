# Hi?...
I'm J and since I kinda don't want to share my name online, I just typed a random character and just went with it (lol).

In this repository, I will answer all questions you may have about me. So let's get on with it!

## What do you do?
Programming (mostly). I usually just think of a project that is too big for a single person and then I tried to implement it, found a problem, spent 2-4 hours trying to troubleshoot them and then I fail and give up, I guess.
## Are you good at programmi-
No.

## What are you working on right now?
A programming language, I want to name it Ghost. It is supposed to be as simple python but with as much features as c++.

<sub>**Also I'm creating a chess engine.**</sub>

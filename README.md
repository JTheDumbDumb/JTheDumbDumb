# Hi?...
I'm J and since I kinda don't want to share my name online, I just typed a random character and just went with it (lol).

In this repository, I will \**try*\* to answer all questions you may have about me. So let's get on with it!

## What do you do?
Programming (mostly) (more like noobgramming lol). I usually just think of a project that's too big for a single person and then try to implement it, find a problem, spend 2-4 hours trying to troubleshoot it and then fail and give up the project. That loop of torment goes on forever until I actually finish a project and then take a break for a month. Miserable innit?

## Are you good at programmi-
**No.**

## What are you working on right now?
1. A programming language, I want to name it Reapr. It is supposed to be simple but powerful. Still on progress, though. 
2. A pokemon REST API (On planning stage), I've been making a lot of discord bots and I want to create my own REST API, I've always loved pokemon, so, I want to merge those two things together into an API where you can send the pokemon number to the API and it will send back a pokemon. (For example, 1 => bulbasaur.)
3. My version of Robert Nystrom's jlox.
4. A coding game using SDL (I know there's a lot of them already but shut up).

## How can I contact you?
I'd love to chat with you via email (but your mail may not be replied since I don\'t have notifications on my email), or discord Uncle He#0640.

## What language do you use primarily?
C++, C, Python, sometimes Java.

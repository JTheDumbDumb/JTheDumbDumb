# Hi?...
I'm J and since I kinda don't want to share my name online, I just typed a random character and just went with it (lol).

In this repository, I will \*try to answer all questions you may have about me. So let's get on with it!

## **DOES THE J IN YOUR NAME EVEN MEAN ANYTHING?!?!?!.!.!**
No.

## What do you do?
Programming (mostly). I usually just think of a project that's too big for a single person and then try to implement it, find a problem, spend 2-4 hours trying to troubleshoot it and then I fail and give up the project, I guess.

## Are you good at programmi-
**No.**

## What are you working on right now?
A programming language, I want to name it Ghost. It is supposed to be as simple python but with as much features as c++. Still scratching my noggin on how I can make it, though.

<sub>**Also I'm creating a chess engine. (But I hit a roadblock and I think I'm going to abandon it.)**</sub>

## How can I contact you?
Uhhh, don't.

## What language do you use primarily?
C++, C, Python, sometimes Java.
